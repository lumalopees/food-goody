# Project Objective: To develop a cooking recipes website with an elegant and responsive design, using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies (with the mentioned restrictions).

Specific Features:

     Home page with list of popular recipes.
     Individual pages for each recipe with details.
     Search bar to find specific recipes.
     Button to toggle between light/dark view.
     Responsive to different screen sizes.

Design and Style: The design will be elegant, with dark and neutral colors to suit your preferences. The font used will be "Roboto" for a modern look.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (functions, loops, arrays, if/else, objects and JSON).

Here is the detailed order:

HTML:

     Create the basic structure of the site with the appropriate sections (header, list of recipes, footer).
     In the recipe list section, create cards for each recipe displaying an image, title and summary.
     Create links to individual recipe pages.

css:

     Set the font to "Roboto" for the entire site.
     Set up a dark, neutral color scheme.
     Style the header with a dark background, logo and search bar.
     Style the recipe cards with a subtle shadow and smooth transition on hover.
     Create a stylesheet for the responsive version of the site.

JS:

     Create a JSON object containing recipe data (title, image, ingredients, instructions, etc.).
     Use loops and arrays to dynamically generate recipe cards on the homepage.
     Implement a function to toggle between light and dark modes.
     Create a function to display recipe details when a card is clicked.

Responsiveness:

     Use media queries in CSS to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
     Make sure your website is legible and functional on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

This is a detailed summary of the web development application based on your specifications. Keep in mind that this is just a creative example and you can adapt or tweak parts of the design as you see fit. If you have any questions or need more information, I'm here to help!
